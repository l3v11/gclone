# Gclone

Gclone *(a modified version of the [rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone))* is a command-line program to sync files and directories to and from Google Drive.

## Features

- Synced with rclone version for getting the latest features and bug fixes
- Provides dynamic replacement of the Service Accounts (SAs) for bypassing the 750GB/day limit of Google Drive


## Instructions

### 1. Configuring the service_account_file_path

Add `service_account_file_path` in config file for dynamic replacement of Service Accounts (SAs). Replaces when `rateLimitExceeded` or `downloadQuotaExceeded` error occurs.

> ***rclone.conf*** example:
```
[gc]
type = drive  
scope = drive  
service_account_file = /root/accounts/1.json  
service_account_file_path = /root/accounts/  
root_folder_id = root  
```
**Note:** `/root/accounts/` folder must contain **SA files** (*.json)
  
### 2. Copying data

```
gclone copy gc:{source} gc:{destination} --drive-server-side-across-configs
```
**Note:** Provide Team Drive ID or Folder ID as `source` and `destination`

## Caveats

Creating Service Accounts (SAs) allows you to bypass some of Google's quotas. Tools like Autorclone and gclone automatically rotates SAs for continuous multi-terabyte file transfer.

> Quotas SAs **CAN** bypass:
* Google 'copy/upload' quota (750GB/account/day)
* Google 'download' quota (10TB/account/day)

> Quotas SAs **CANNOT** bypass:
* Google 'Shared Drive' quota (~20TB/drive/day)
* Google 'file owner' quota (~2TB/day)
